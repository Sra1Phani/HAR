Human Activity Recognition

Aim         : The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed i.e., WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING based on data collected from a smartphones.

Dataset 	: The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
		
			For each record in the dataset the following is provided:
				o Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
				o Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
				o A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
				o Its activity label.
				o An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Techniques	: Data Standardization, Principal Component Analysis, Oblique Decision Trees
Tools		: R, RStudio
